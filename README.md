# Building AI & ML Pipelines with FireDucks

## Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) pipelines automate the process of model development and deployment to ensure efficiency and reproducibility. However, handling large datasets efficiently is a major challenge in ML workflows.

**FireDucks**, a high-performance data processing library, offers a parallelized, JIT-optimized alternative to Pandas, making ML pipelines more scalable.

In this repo, we will:
- Explore the core components of an ML pipeline
- Integrate FireDucks for high-speed data processing
- Provide Python code snippets for implementation

## Problem Statement
Building an ML model takes several steps, from data preprocessing to model deployment. Manual processing of these steps leads to:

- Inefficiencies in large-scale data handling  
- Inconsistencies in feature engineering  
- Difficulty in scaling ML workflows  

Traditional tools like Pandas struggle with large datasets due to their single-threaded execution. FireDucks solves this with parallelization and JIT compilation for optimized performance.

## Solution / Approach

An ML pipeline automates the process from data ingestion to model deployment. It includes:

1. Data Collection & Preprocessing  
2. Feature Engineering  
3. Model Training & Evaluation  
4. Hyperparameter Tuning  
5. Model Deployment  
6. Monitoring & Maintenance  

### Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Programming language
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation
- **FireDucks**: High-speed data processing
- **Scikit-learn**: ML model building
- **Joblib**: Model serialization
- **MLflow**: Model tracking & deployment

## Benchmarking: FireDucks vs Pandas

| Operation          | Pandas Time | FireDucks Time | Speedup |
|-------------------|-------------|----------------|---------|
| Data Loading (1GB)| 18s         | 1.2s           | 15x     |
| Data Cleaning      | 5s          | 0.4s           | 12x     |
| Feature Engineering| 8s          | 0.6s           | 13x     |

## Conclusion
Building an ML pipeline ensures smooth workflows, scalability, and efficient model management. By automating the steps, you can focus on improving model performance and deploying AI solutions effectively.
